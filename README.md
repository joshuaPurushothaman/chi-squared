# Is my 6-sided die fair?
I use the Chi-Squared Goodness of Fit test to see if my 6-sided die is fair given a sample 100 rolls.
Corresponds to my [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=472CTkexvxc).

## Running
This was developed with Python 3.11, but most 3.x versions should be compatible.
`py chi_squared.py # or python3, python, etc`
